## Usage

### Scan all local Docker images:
```bash
python3 docker-security-scan.py
```

### Scan only specific images:
```bash
python3 docker-security-scan.py --images repo1:tag1 repo2:tag2
```

### Example:
```bash
python3 docker-security-scan.py --images ubuntu:latest myapp:1.0
```

After completion, open the generated HTML file (e.g., `docker_security_scan_report_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.html`) in your browser.

## Output

- **Dashboard:** Pie and bar charts for overall and per-image vulnerability distribution.
- **Summary Table:** All images with counts by severity.
- **Per-Image Details:** Expandable tables with package, version, summary, fixed versions, CVEs (as clickable badges), and references.
- **Navigation:** Jump links and "Back to Top" for easy browsing.
- **Logs:** Detailed progress and error logs are printed to the console.

## Troubleshooting

- **No images found:**  
  Ensure you have local Docker images (`docker images`).

- **JFrog CLI not found:**  
  Install and configure JFrog CLI as described above.

- **Jinja2 not installed:**  
  Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

- **Docker not running:**  
  Start Docker and ensure you have permission to run Docker commands.
